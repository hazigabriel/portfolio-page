                    <p>
                        In the near future Iâ€™m looking forward to learn Redux, Typescript and Node.js. In the distant future I plan to learn about the back-end and become a Full-stack developer.

                        Besides coding and adding pictures with myself and cool background rocks (pretty cool rocks, right?) I enjoy cycling, cooking, taking pictures and reading.
